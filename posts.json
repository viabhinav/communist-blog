Sarkar specifically blamed the Trinamool leaders for the attack and eventual death, ' the plea said.\r\n\r\n**'The Trinamool has dehumanised its political opponents, specifically targeting the BJP and its members and workers, branding them as fascists and bigots,'** it added.\r\n\r\nThe petition urged the apex court to pass an order directing the CBI to launch an enquiry and investigate the instances of ** 'rampant violence, murders and rape'** that have been carried out by the workers of Trinamool across the state ';.\r\n\r\nIt also sought directions to the West Bengal government to file a detailed status report with respect to the FIRs registered, arrests made, and steps taken by it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the TMC leaders have alleged that the violence in the state was as a result of infighting within the BJP camp.\r\n\r\nBJP IT cell could have given trolls some time off after results. All cases on SM are BJP intra-party fights. Three+ factions in Bengal. They hate each other. MO-SHA came here and spread hate for the last four months. Bengal wants peace and harmony. BJP wants divisiveness: TMC MP Derek O'Brien tweeted."}}
